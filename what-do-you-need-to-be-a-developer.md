# What do you need to be a developer

I think that a developer is made of some qualities, and
they are so counterintuitive, that is worth taking the time
to write them down.

## Kindness

*Kindness* (or _awareness_, which basically is the twin sister) is the first of the characteristics. You will need to be _kind with customers_, listening to them very carefully, being willing to put a lot of time in understanding them, who they are, what they need. You will need to be _kind with your team mates_, knowing that the best that can happen to a you all is to be _aware of the differences between the members and to leverage on them_, so that the team is more than the sum of the singles. You will need to be _kind with yourself_, because you will screw up, you will be _ignorant, weak, mad at yourself_, and for these reasons _still consider yourself worth_ and continue with your work with passion.

### Why is Kindness counterintuitive

We live in the years of badassery, of showing strength to be considered. If you are kind, someone will take advantage of you. Find consolation in being a decent
human being.

## Learning

*Learning* is what we do. We learn about __*programming*__, every day, because the _technology is always moving_, always advancing. We learn _new tools_, _how to use them and_ we learn also _*when*_ to use them and when not to use them. If you do TDD (as you should), _every test_ suite is basically a _list of things you learn about your domain_. We learn about ourselves, because we also change. We learn about our product, about its users. When we don't learn, it can only mean we are not being kind/aware enough.

### Why is Learning counterintuitive

We know that "we are learning continuosly" yet we stuggle with admitting our ignorance, and we sometimes deride the one of the others. Find consolation in the frontier of knowledge: the more you know, the more the perimeter of the things you know you don't know, grows.

## Practice

*Practice* makes perfect. There is a _lot of programming_ involved _in developing_, and _*programming is a hard activity*_, very error prone. Practice to make less mistakes, learn how not to do mistakes, use the memory in the muscles of your fingers. _Practice in order to teach others_ the discipline required for our peculiar trade. You will _save_ your and their _time_. Do _katas_, so that you can _practice intention_ in writing/refactoring a program. Practice your _interpersonal skills, you are not alone_ in this world, and you really can't be. _Practice meditation_, you will *learn* to be *kind*.

### Why is Practice counterintuitive

You work all day, yet you need to practice? Intentional practice (practice to learn) is not the same as doing things. We need time and practice to learn. Find consolation in the knowledge that what constitutes a grand master, is that practice every day.

## Conclusion: Can I be a developer without these things

Yes for sure. You can be a bad, or sad developer. As for everything, you will be the one on whom the consequences will ripple. Choose wisely. Do your list. This is only mine.
